# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized RDP Access
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/Goodka7/Threat-Hunting/blob/main/resources/Threat_Hunt_Event(TOR%20Usage).md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Tor Browser

##  Scenario

Management suspects that some employees may be using TOR browsers to bypass network security controls because recent network logs show unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of employees discussing ways to access restricted sites during work hours. The goal is to detect any TOR usage and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks. If any use of TOR is found, notify management.

### High-Level TOR-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `tor(.exe)` or `firefox(.exe)` file events.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of installation or usage.
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` Table

Searched for any file that had the string "tor", ".exe", ".txt", or ".json" in it. 

At 3:39:26 PM on January 20, 2025, the user "labuser" created a file named "tor.exe" on the device "hardmodevm." The file was saved in the folder path: C:\Users\labuser\Desktop\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Tor\tor.exe. The file's SHA256 hash is c3b431779278278cda8d2bf5de5d4da38025717630bfeae1a82c927d0703cd28.	

The search yielded other items including the creation of a folder (tor-shopping-list) which held several artifacts of interest: several .txt files and a few .jsons, with names that suggest illicit activity.


**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "hardmodevm"
| where FileName contains (“tor”, “.txt” , “.exe” , “.json”)
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "labuser"
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

### 2. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Searched for any `ProcessCommandLine` that contained the string "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.4.exe". 

At 3:30:55 PM on January 20, 2025, the user "labuser" created a process called "cmd.exe" on the device "hardmodevm." The process was located in C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe, with the SHA256 hash of badf4752413cb0cbdc03fb95820ca167f0cdc63b597ccdb5ef43111180e088b0. 

The command executed was:<span style="color: green;">
"cmd.exe" /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Start-Process \"C:\Downloads\tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.4.exe\" -ArgumentList '/S' -NoNewWindow -Wait"</span>, which initiated the installation of the Tor Browser, silently.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName  == "hardmodevm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.4.exe"
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName, Command = ProcessCommandLine
```

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for TOR Browser Execution

Searched for any indication that user "labuser" actually opened the TOR browser.The results showed user “labuser” accessed tor.exe (tor browser), firefox.exe(tor browser) several times:

At 3:42:33 PM to 3:42:26 PM (within the same minute), multiple instances of the "firefox.exe" process were created. These processes, all related to the Tor Browser, were executed from C:\Users\labuser\Desktop\Tor Browser\Browser\firefox.exe with various command parameters to handle different processes related to the browser's content processing, tab management, utility tasks, and GPU handling. Each "firefox.exe" instance had its own set of parameters, such as channels, preferences, and other configuration settings related to how the browser should run.
The SHA256 hash for all instances of "firefox.exe" is the same: 3034311292fade8a24ab8e7312cfb7132153c14b9383439b527e8296fe06a492.

At 3:42:49 PM on January 20, 2025, the user "labuser" created a process called "tor.exe" on the device "hardmodevm." The process was located at C:\Users\labuser\Desktop\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Tor\tor.exe, with the SHA256 hash c3b431779278278cda8d2bf5de5d4da38025717630bfeae1a82c927d0703cd28. 


**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName  == "hardmodevm"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "tor-browser.exe")
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName, Command = ProcessCommandLine
```

---

### 4. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table for TOR Network Connections

Searched for any indication the TOR browser was used to establish a connection using any of the known TOR ports. The results showed user “labuser” did indeed use tor to connect to an url.

At 3:43:03 PM on January 20, 2025, a successful connection was made by the user "labuser" from the device "hardmodevm" to the remote IP address 45.21.116.144 on port 9001. The connection was made using the file "tor.exe," and the remote URL accessed was https://www.35yt53tip6fr4hoov4a.com.


**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName  == "hardmodevm"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "labuser"
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9040", "9050", "9051", "9150", "80", "443")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath  
| order by Timestamp desc
```

## Summary

The user "labuser" on the device "hardmodevm" installed and used the Tor Browser, taking actions that raised concerns. First, "labuser" silently initiated the installation of the Tor Browser through a PowerShell command. After the installation, they created the "tor.exe" file and executed it, which started the Tor service with specific configurations. Additionally, multiple instances of "firefox.exe" associated with the Tor Browser were launched, and the user successfully connected to the Tor network, accessing a remote IP and URL, suggesting the use of Tor for anonymous browsing. Furthermore, a folder (tor-shopping-list) containing several .txt and .json files was created, holding several files with names indicating potential illicit activity. These actions suggest that the user may have been engaging in suspicious or unauthorized activities using the Tor network.

---

## Response Taken

TOR usage was confirmed on the endpoint `hardmodevm` by the user `labuser`. The device was isolated, and the user's direct manager was notified.
